# mixin
Self-education project to compare different mixin approaches in TypeScript

## Definition
A mixin is a special kind of multiple inheritance. It's a form of object composition, where component features get mixed into a composite object so that properties of each mixin become properties of the composite object.
  
In OOP, a mixin is a class that contains methods for use by other classes.  

Functional mixins are composable factories which connect together in a pipeline; each function adding some properties or behaviors.

## Problem
* There's no fair multiple inheritance in TS/JS in 2020.
